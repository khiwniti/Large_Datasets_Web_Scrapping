# Python Web Scraping Application

This project is a Python web scraping application that utilizes a scheduling mechanism to scrape data from the web, integrates with the Kraken proxy service for anonymity, and stores the scraped data in AWS S3. It also includes a FastAPI server for API access.

│   └── s3_storage.py    # Manages storage of data in AWS S3
├── main.py              # Entry point of the application
├── requirements.txt     # Lists project dependencies

```

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/python-web-scraping-app.git
   cd python-web-scraping-app
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   Ensure you have Python installed, then run:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure settings:**
   Update the `config.py` file with your AWS credentials, Kraken proxy settings, and any scheduling parameters.

## Usage

To run the application, execute the following command:
```
python main.py
```

This will start the FastAPI server on `http://0.0.0.0:8000` and initialize the scheduler to start the web scraping process according to the defined schedule.
